    "1. The central area, with Ward 5 having the highest crime rate, followed by Ward 2 and Ward 1, exhibits elevated crime levels, which can be attributed to several factors. One prominent factor is the higher population density in these districts, as they serve as hubs for residential and commercial activities. Additionally, the increased commercialization in these central wards often leads to a greater influx of people, providing more opportunities for criminal activities to occur.\n",
    "2. Income levels are often correlated with crime rates, and it's a common finding that higher-income areas tend to have lower crime rates. For instance, Ward 3 and Ward 4 record the lowest crime numbers, which can be plausibly attributed to their proximity to affluent areas near Washington, D.C., such as Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and McLean.  Higher-income areas often have more resources to invest in community infrastructure, including better street lighting, security systems, and neighborhood watch programs, which can deter crime. At the same time, as we can glean from the preceding exploratory data analysis (EDA), theft constitutes the largest proportion within all crime categories. High income areas tend to experience fewer incidents of theft, a factor that significantly contributes to lower crime rates in such regions."
